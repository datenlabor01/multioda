This global system is managed by the Animal Production and Health Division (AGA). It provides National Coordinators for the Management of AnGR (NC) nominated by countries with a secure means to control the entry, updating and accessing of their national data. Throughout the existence of DAD-IS, population data have been lacking for many breeds. This information is critical for guiding the national management of AnGR and the calculation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2 (SDG = Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 2.5.2 = Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction), for which AGA is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) focal point. As of March 2018, across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 67 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown risk status, 26 percent as at risk, and 7 percent as not at risk of extinction. The main reason for the data gap is lack of population data on country level. Livestock censuses, if carried out at all, are expensive and thus not sufficiently frequent relative to the annual SDG reporting. Moreover, they usually do not provide information on breed level. Therefore, countries need cost efficient solutions allowing them to estimate regularly the population sizes of their AnGR. The project will update a document describing the methodology and adjust a simple data entry tool (access data base tool) allowing estimating the breed population at country level. Remark - All project countries can be found on the DAC list. Therefore, 100 % of the project budget is allocated to ODA.",Food and Agricultural Organisation,"United Nations (UN) agency, fund or commission",GCP/GLO/960/GER,155104.9999999999,53621.0,

Specifically, the initiative will create a platform to engage talented young experts and multipliers from across the OSCE area in an inclusive process to develop, support and help realize a common vision for the OSCE in 2030 and beyond. This will strengthen the OSCE network on Youth and Security, raise the OSCE's profile among young people across the OSCE region, and to encourage young people to engage in security debates. Furthermore, it will promote the implementation and further development of concrete tools for youth mainstreaming. In 2025, the OSCE will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, which remains a cornerstone for promoting the role of youth in peace and security. It is also halfway between 2020 and 2030.
