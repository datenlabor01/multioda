For the handling of highly pathogenic viruses and infected insects, the Institute has laboratories of the highest biosafety level (BSL-4) and a BSL-3 insectary. The Institute's health care services include specific laboratory diagnostics of tropical diseases and other rare infections, capacity building as well as the consultation of the scientific community, politics and the general public, which essentially contribute to the Institute's national reputation. The Institute has been appointed by the Federal Ministery of Health as the National Reference Center (NRC) for the detection of all tropical pathogens as well as by the WHO as Collaborating Center for arboviruses and haemorrhagic fever viruses. In collaboration with the Ghanaian Health Ministery and the University of Kumasi the Institute has been operating a modern research and training center in the West-African rain forest for over twentyfive years, which is availableto external research groups. The teaching activities comprise a three months full-time course on all aspects of tropical medicine for physicans as well as a training program for PhD students at the Institute and a number of activities on continuing education in topics related to travel medicine and international health.
